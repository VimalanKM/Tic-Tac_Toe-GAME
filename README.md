# Tic-Tac_Toe-GAME
A python developed automated simulation where 2 bots play the game with random markings(without any strategy) and the winner is announced.
This is a mini project done to simulate the randomness that evolves when the game is played without any strategy.
We here observe that both players have equal chances in winning, losing or ending up in a draw.
But as the number of games simulated increases (about 100000 times and more), we could observe that the player who starts first has more chance of winning even at random markings.
We could conclude that the player who starts first has an unfair advantage as to win the game even when both players mark at random.
